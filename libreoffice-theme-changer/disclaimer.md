We build LO-TC with love, but please remember to use it at your own risk. We are not responsible for the legality of the content \(for example\) that you use in the theme. All responsibilities are entirely held by each theme creator.

LO-TC works by changing some user settings, but the LO-TC developer does not store the user's private content at all. Any damage that occurs to the system caused by errors in the use of LO-TC \(of course we never expect that\), is entirely the responsibility of the user.
