# Update the Manifest File

In the manifest.xml file, you actually only need to complete a few things. 

First, your social media site or url, secondly, a description of the theme that you created, and the last one is add the required links \(maximum 2 links\) that relate to your new theme. 

Describe your theme briefly, we recommend not exceeding 250 characters. Take advantage of links to direct users to sites that make it possible to explain themes more comprehensively.
